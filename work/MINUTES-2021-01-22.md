# Minutes 2021-01-22

Who: David, Graeme, Marc, Steven, Francesco, Bernhard

## Actions

- Move working material to GitHub, from Google Docs and Sheets [Graeme]
- Need basic types and syntax in lesson 2
- [Stephen] to check compound datatypes is broken up as intended
- Functions are introduced after compound types
	- Circular dependencies!
	- Make small intros when a concept is only needed to discuss something else
- Rvalue references are advanced!
	- Range based for loops with `&&`!
	- `std::move()`
- `auto` - should we have this early?
    - Yes
- Follow style of *Accelerated C++* for advanced topics (Koenig and Moo)
    - They have an excellent way of giving minimum information when something is needed before its proper introduction
- Interfaces looks too early (before classes!)
- Templates - want this early
