General goals of this module :
* An introduction mainly around C++ variables, functions, predefined scalar types. The "C" level, but in the modern C+ way.
* Give directly modern C++17 good habits, and avoid to debate differences with C++98/03/11/14, unless absolutely necessary for the understanding of old code.
* Because some good practices rely on the standard libray, use the standard library from the beginning, while not explaining the details yet.

TIMING
* 3 hours max
* ~10 steps
* half time for exercices
=> 10 minutes max for each pr√©sentation.

WHAT WE DO NOT ADRESS & DO NOT USE IN THIS MODULE
* printf : too old school
* std::array (instead of raw C arrays) : too innovative,
  and there are still issues with static vs dynamic evaluation of the size parameter,
  and automatic parameter deduction not available in all situations.
* Pointers, RAII, smart pointers, etc. for another Lesson
* Object orientation : structs, classes, objects... for another Lesson
* Generic programming : templates... for another Lesson
 
WHAT WE DO ADRESS IN THIS MODULE
* ordinary variables
* buitin types
* ordinary functions, references & const references
* std::cout, std::vector
* range-based loops
* auto
