# Comments

## General comments

- range based loops should use `auto &&` to automatically match the best type
- always try to write the kind of code that would be used in production...
  - and if there's some reason not to use that code in production then add the caveat

## A few observations on the level of the compound types lesson

- Make sure that the notation for function signatures is introduced with functions (`int â†’ int`)
- Too much time spent on different ways to initialise and set members
- Uninitialised instances needs to be talked about elsewhere (even as part of the basic types discussion)
- Ternary operator is used and maybe not needed? We have to make sure it's covered earlier
- Move the whole classes discussion to a separate lesson?

- Stylewise this is a different beast from what I wrote (polish later)

- The Classes material should be on its own
  - and split across multiple episodes
- sp. senbible -> sensible
- constructor example code, it's a bit hard to see where the constructor is - highlight with a comment?

- in a core course we should not even mention `union`!
  - make this an advanced topic!
